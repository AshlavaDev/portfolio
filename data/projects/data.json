    "projectDescription": 
      "This full-stack project uses CRUD to process blog posts. A user can create a post, see their own posts and posts of others, update their own posts, and delete their own posts. Furhtermore, they can update their own profile information. It uses Next Authentication for sign up and login, and the site renders differently depending on whether they are signed in or not.It is fully mobile responsive in design and features both a light scheme and a dark scheme depending on browser settings. The schemes are effectively reverses of each other and with the exception of some red elements for links and danger warnings, are on the same gray scale of the default gray of Tailwindcss. Font is imported with Next's Google font imports.",
    "projectLimitations": 
      "There are 4 limitations, which are things I would like to add. There is limited security checks and no email validation. The first is that the content section of a blog renders all as one block even though the textarea input allows for new lines. The second is that there is no search functionality which would be useful. The last is that there is no toggle between dark and light mode, rather it relies on the system or browser.",

    "projectDescription":
      "This website is a miniature paint library (hence the name Athenuem, an ancient word for library). It is designed to eventually have all paints created for use in miniature gaming, of which there are way more than you would think Currently the site only has the paints of 2 companies and that is already several hundred. And finding them is manual work for me. The database, built with Postgres using Supabase, is created from a lot of information I collected including the paint name, company, range, colour category, paint type, and a hex code for the colour if I can get it. Eventually I want the ability to search these colours properly, as opposed to by certain criteria, and to have similar colours pop up so people can compare ranges. This was originally a React project built as my final project in web dev school, and then rebuilt using SvelteKit with a few more features added to it such as pagination.",
    "projectLimitations": 
      "The three biggest limitations currently are that the website does not seem to want to be hosted anywhere, there is no search bar type functionality yet, and the comparison between paint ranges does not exist on either the frontend or the database.",

    "projectDescription":
      "This static site was built using Next 13, TailwindCSS, and Typescript (ie Next 13 and the options it gives me) with a few small libraries added. The idea originally came while I was working on a design assignment during a web design class as part of my certification, and after more than a year of it sitting in a Figma file I opened it up and made what was in the file (with a few changes) and fleshed it out into a full site. The concept stems from my love of cyberpunk things, which greatly informs the aesthetic and content, even though it is from a corporate perspective given they are usually the antagonists of the genre. The features show though are meant to be reflective of what a small business website would contain even if the design is a little different.",
    "projectLimitations": "The biggest limitations is that the form is not how a regular form would work, and images and content is local to the site files. The form was purposely not set up so that anyone viewing the site would not spam me (or themselves or whoever owns the email that was inputted into the form). As for local storage, this was mostly due to an abundance of caution on my part with using resources for thigns that won't change while the project exists.",
